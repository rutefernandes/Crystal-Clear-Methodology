  <mainDescription>For the average project, the team is being assembled during the chartering period. The people doing the chartering have to&#xD;
deal with a number of variables. The people may or may not know each other, or may show up at some point in the middle of&#xD;
the project, needing time to learn to communicate with each other. If the project emerges from Exploratory 360Â° with a&#xD;
positive result, the team has a sense of where the project is headed, what problem it is tackling, the technology to be&#xD;
used, the project plan, and its business value. This creates an early alignment of goals and actions that strengthens the&#xD;
team.</mainDescription>
