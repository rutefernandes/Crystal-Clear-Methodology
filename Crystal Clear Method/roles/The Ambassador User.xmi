  <mainDescription>The system will be better suited to what the users need if the developers have access to an expert on system usage. The&#xD;
value the system brings to the organization is very sensitive to the information the developers get about the usage&#xD;
context. That means it is important that the team has easy access to proper usage experts. How much of that user's time&#xD;
does the team need? It would be nice to have the expert user available to the team the whole time, of course. That is&#xD;
rarely practical. Some methodologies suggest or require the user expert be present 50% of the time. That would also be&#xD;
wonderful, of course, but is usually also impractical. My experience is that if the team can phone the Ambassador User&#xD;
periodically during the week to ask questions, and gets a few hours (even as low as two hours) of dedicated time each week,&#xD;
they can work through their questions, get good requirements in</mainDescription>
