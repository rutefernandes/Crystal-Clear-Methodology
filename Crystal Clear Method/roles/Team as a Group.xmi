  <mainDescription>Crystal Clear only names the above three roles specifically. There will be other people on the project. How they divide up&#xD;
the rest of the project roles is up to them. In particular, someone, or several people, will have to capture the&#xD;
requirements in use case or user story form. Also, someone will have to act as coordinator. Perhaps the Lead Designer can&#xD;
off-load this onto someone else who has good communications skill.</mainDescription>
