  <mainDescription>The person given the assignment of Lead Designer has a complicated job description, which is not normally spelled out in&#xD;
advance. This person is often the best designer on the team, a person who could, in principle, design the entire system.&#xD;
This person is also supposed to train the younger members of the team, talk with the Executive Sponsor and end users, build&#xD;
a project plan, and manage the development of the project while also designing the most difficult part of the system. It is&#xD;
an impossible job description, except that it is carried out successfully by many (overworked) people around the world. The&#xD;
best thing the Executive Sponsor can do for the Lead Designer is to provide a second expert developer. This second expert&#xD;
developer should be the one who handles the most difficult design tasks, because this second expert developer is not so&#xD;
likely to get caught up in meetings about users, plans, status, interfaces and so on</mainDescription>
