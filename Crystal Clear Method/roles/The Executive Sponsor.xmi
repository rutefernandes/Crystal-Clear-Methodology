  <mainDescription>The Executive Sponsor is the person who ultimately cares that the project gets done. This person provides the money – or at&#xD;
least arranges for it to show up – and provides essential direction to the group. This person highlights the priorities the&#xD;
group needs to be aware of, and gets the project not only monetary support, but also logistical and emotional support.&#xD;
Often, the Executive Sponsor is also the domain expert. During the project, the Executive Sponsor needs to remind the&#xD;
development team of their true goal and keep them appraised of any changes in business direction that affects the project's&#xD;
direction. In return, the team needs to keep the Executive Sponsor appraised of the project's progress (burn charts are&#xD;
excellent for this).</mainDescription>
